Advent of Code 2021 daily challenges. For the month of December in 2021, daily coding challenges are uploaded every day until Christmas. I spent winter break to solve as many problems as I could.
Each number on each file corresponds to that day's problem. For example, aoc2 corresponds to the problem on the second day. Additionally, each day has two problems, and each day has a folder that has the day number and "a" and "b" for parts a and be respectively (e.g. aoc2a for day two part one and aoc3b for day three part two).
